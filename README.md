OpenClaw is a powerful AI agent framework that can now run natively on Android devices. This installer automates the entire setup process, handling environment configuration, dependency installation, and networking fixes specific to Android.

## ✨ Features

-  **One-Command Installation** - Fully automated setup process
-  **Auto-Update System** - Script checks for updates on every run
-  **Android Networking Fix** - Automatically patches the Error 13 issue
-  **Optimized for Android 12+** - Tested on modern Android devices
-  **Minimal Storage Impact** - Efficient PRoot Debian environment

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Android device running Android 12 or higher
- [Termux](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/) installed from F-Droid (if you encounter issue using Fdroid's version, you may try to use google playstore's version)
- At least 2GB of free storage space
- Stable internet connection

##  Quick Start

### Method 1: One-Line Install (Recommended)

Run this command in Termux:

```bash
# Termux main terminal
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iyeoh88-svg/openclaw-android/main/install.sh | bash

# First time setup (enter debian)
proot-distro login debian

# Run the openclaw setup wizard (inside debian)
openclaw onboard
```

### Method 2: Manual Download

```bash
# Download the installer
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iyeoh88-svg/openclaw-android/main/install.sh

# Make it executable
chmod +x install.sh

# Run the installer
./install.sh
```

## 📖 What Gets Installed

The script automatically:

1.  Updates Termux packages
2.  Installs and configures PRoot-Distro with Debian
3.  Installs Node.js v22 via NVM
4.  Creates networking shim to fix Android Error 13
5.  Installs OpenClaw globally
6.  Sets up convenient aliases for daily use
7.  Configures the environment for optimal performance

##  Daily Usage

After installation, use these simple commands:

### Starting OpenClaw

**Session 1 - Gateway (The Brain)**
```bash
# In Termux
proot-distro login debian

# Inside Debian
start-claw
```

**Session 2 - TUI (The Interface)**
```bash
# Swipe left in Termux to open new session
proot-distro login debian

# Inside Debian
openclaw tui
```

### Quick Commands

- `start-claw` - Launch the OpenClaw gateway
- `openclaw tui` - Open the terminal interface
- `openclaw onboard` - Configure API keys
- `update-openclaw` - Update to latest version

##  Troubleshooting

### Performance Issues

If OpenClaw is running slowly:

```bash
# In standard Termux (not Debian)
termux-wake-lock
```

This prevents Android from throttling CPU when the screen is off.

### Storage Issues

```bash
# Inside Debian
npm cache clean --force
apt clean
```

### API Configuration

```bash
# Inside Debian
openclaw onboard
```

Follow the prompts to configure Gemini, OpenAI, or other providers.

### Complete Reinstall

```bash
# In standard Termux
./install.sh --reinstall
```

##  System Requirements

| Component | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **OS** | Android 12+ |
| **Storage** | 2GB minimum, 4GB recommended |
| **RAM** | 4GB minimum, 6GB+ recommended |
| **Termux** | Latest version from F-Droid |

## 🔄 Updating

The installer automatically checks for updates each time you run it. To manually update:

```bash
# Re-run the installer
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iyeoh88-svg/openclaw-android/main/install.sh | bash
```

##  Known Issues

- **Error 13**: Fixed automatically by the installer
- **Performance**: Use `termux-wake-lock` for better performance
- **Battery**: OpenClaw may drain battery faster; keep device charged during intensive tasks
