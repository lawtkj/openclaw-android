OpenClaw is a powerful AI agent framework that can now run natively on Android devices. This installer automates the entire setup process, handling environment configuration, dependency installation, and networking fixes specific to Android.

## ✨ Features

- 🚀 **One-Command Installation** - Fully automated setup process
- 🔄 **Auto-Update System** - Script checks for updates on every run
- 🔧 **Android Networking Fix** - Automatically patches the Error 13 issue
- 📱 **Optimized for Android 12+** - Tested on modern Android devices
- 💾 **Minimal Storage Impact** - Efficient PRoot Debian environment

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Android device running Android 12 or higher
- [Termux](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/) installed from F-Droid
- At least 2GB of free storage space
- Stable internet connection

> ⚠️ **Important**: Do not install Termux from Google Play Store. Use the F-Droid version for compatibility.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Method 1: One-Line Install (Recommended)

Run this command in Termux:

```bash
# Termux main terminal
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iyeoh88-svg/openclaw-android/main/install.sh | bash

# First time setup (enter debian)
proot-distro login debian

# Run the openclaw setup wizard (inside debian)
openclaw onboard
```

### Method 2: Manual Download

```bash
# Download the installer
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iyeoh88-svg/openclaw-android/main/install.sh

# Make it executable
chmod +x install.sh

# Run the installer
./install.sh
```

## 📖 What Gets Installed

The script automatically:

1. ✅ Updates Termux packages
2. ✅ Installs and configures PRoot-Distro with Debian
3. ✅ Installs Node.js v22 via NVM
4. ✅ Creates networking shim to fix Android Error 13
5. ✅ Installs OpenClaw globally
6. ✅ Sets up convenient aliases for daily use
7. ✅ Configures the environment for optimal performance

## 🎮 Daily Usage

After installation, use these simple commands:

### Starting OpenClaw

**Session 1 - Gateway (The Brain)**
```bash
# In Termux
proot-distro login debian

# Inside Debian
start-claw
```

**Session 2 - TUI (The Interface)**
```bash
# Swipe left in Termux to open new session
proot-distro login debian

# Inside Debian
openclaw tui
```

### Quick Commands

- `start-claw` - Launch the OpenClaw gateway
- `openclaw tui` - Open the terminal interface
- `openclaw onboard` - Configure API keys
- `update-openclaw` - Update to latest version

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Performance Issues

If OpenClaw is running slowly:

```bash
# In standard Termux (not Debian)
termux-wake-lock
```

This prevents Android from throttling CPU when the screen is off.

### Storage Issues

```bash
# Inside Debian
npm cache clean --force
apt clean
```

### API Configuration

```bash
# Inside Debian
openclaw onboard
```

Follow the prompts to configure Gemini, OpenAI, or other providers.

### Complete Reinstall

```bash
# In standard Termux
./install.sh --reinstall
```
