##  Features

-  **One-Command Installation** - Fully automated setup in 5-15 minutes

-  **Efficient** - Minimal storage footprint with PRoot Debian
-  **Secure** - Passwordless sudo for package installs when needed

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **2GB+ free storage** (4GB recommended)

### Manual Download & Install

If you prefer to review the script first:

```bash
# Download the installer
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lawtkj/openclaw-android/main/install.sh

# Review it (optional)
less install.sh

# Make executable
chmod +x install.sh

# Run it
./install.sh
```

### Installation Options

```bash
# Force clean reinstall
./install.sh --reinstall

# Skip update check (faster)
./install.sh --skip-update-check

# Show help
./install.sh --help
```

## Login & run OpenClaw setup wizard
```bash
proot-distro login debian --user openclaw
openclaw onboard
```

## 📖 What Gets Installed

The installer automatically:

1.  **Updates Termux packages** (non-interactively)
2.  **Installs PRoot-Distro** with Debian
3.  **Creates `openclaw` user** (dedicated non-root user)
4.  **Installs NVM** (Node Version Manager)
5.  **Installs Node.js v22** (latest LTS)
6.  **Creates Android networking shim** (fixes Error 13 globally)
7.  **Installs OpenClaw** (latest version from npm)
8.  **Configures bash aliases** (convenient shortcuts)
9.  **Sets up environment** (optimized for Android)

**New in v2026.2.14**: Everything runs under the `openclaw` user with passwordless sudo access.

##  Daily Usage

### Starting OpenClaw (Two Sessions Required)

**Session 1 - Gateway:**
```bash
# In Termux
proot-distro login debian --user openclaw

# Inside Debian
start-claw
```

**Session 2 - TUI:**
```bash
# Swipe left in Termux for new session
proot-distro login debian --user openclaw

# Inside Debian
openclaw tui
```

### Essential Commands

**Inside Debian (as openclaw user):**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `start-claw` | Launch OpenClaw gateway |
| `openclaw tui` | Open terminal interface |
| `openclaw onboard` | Automated configuration wizard |
| `openclaw config` | Manual configuration menu |
| `update-openclaw` | Update OpenClaw to latest |
| `claw-status` | Check running processes |
| `claw-logs` | View log files |

**In Termux (not Debian):**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `proot-distro login debian --user openclaw` | Enter Debian as openclaw user |
| `termux-wake-lock` | Prevent CPU throttling |
| `pkg update` | Update Termux packages |

## 🔧 Configuration

### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)

```bash
# Inside Debian
openclaw onboard
```

Walks you through setting up API keys, providers, and channels.

### Option 2: Manual Configuration

If onboarding skips steps (known issue on some Android versions):

```bash
# Inside Debian
openclaw config
```

Lets you manually configure: model, skills, channels, workspace.

### Option 3: Command Line

```bash
# Inside Debian
openclaw config set providers.anthropic.apiKey "your-key-here"
openclaw config set defaultProvider anthropic
openclaw config set defaultModel "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
```

See [GUIDE.md](GUIDE.md#post-installation-setup) for detailed configuration instructions.

## 🆕 New Features in v2026.2.14

### Homebrew Support

You can now install Homebrew and other developer tools:

```bash
# Inside Debian as openclaw user
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Add to PATH
echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# Install packages
brew install cowsay
```

### Non-Root Architecture Benefits

- ✅ **Homebrew works** (refuses to run as root)
- ✅ **Better security** (isolated user environment)
- ✅ **Linux best practices** (proper user separation)
- ✅ **Passwordless sudo** (still can install packages)

## 🔄 Updating

### Update OpenClaw

```bash
# Inside Debian
update-openclaw
```

### Update Installer

The installer auto-checks for updates. To force update:

```bash
# In Termux
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lawtkj/openclaw-android/main/install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh --reinstall
```

### Upgrading from v2026.2.13 or Earlier

**Important**: v2026.2.14 uses a different architecture (non-root user).

See the [complete upgrade guide](GUIDE.md#upgrading-from-older-versions) for:
- Fresh install method (recommended)
- Manual upgrade preserving data
- Migration steps

##  Troubleshooting
